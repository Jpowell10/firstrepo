Atomic Emission 
# This is a Ruby program to determine the Atomic Emisssion details 
# around Hydrogen. By exciting the electron into higher energy levels
# and measuring the Energy emitted afterwards when the electron returns 
# to lower energy levels it is possible to determine whether the energy
# levels are characterized by realtively high, medium or low energy.

# First we wish to welcome the user and prompt them for their E value in
# Scientific Notation. This will be a bit tricky since we will prompt for the 
# Numerical part and exponential part of the E value seperately then have the
# program assemble them into a single variable.
